# Question 1) ***************************************************************
# Write a program to sort 3 numbers in accending order as follows:-
# Start your program with these 4 lines:
# a = 30
# b = 20
# c = 10
# print(a, b, c)
# Algorithm: 
# Compare a and b, if a is bigger swap them
# Compare b and c, if b is bigger swap them
# Now the biggest number is in its right position at the end. All that's left 
# to do is to put a and b into their right positions.
# Finish your program with the following line:
# print(a, b, c)
# When run the output should be:
# 10, 20, 30
