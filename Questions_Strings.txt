
Question 1 **************************************************************

Write a program that gets the middle letter from each of the following words and concatenates them to form a new word.

workplace
polymer
total
without
dog
final

Print out the word.


Question 2 **************************************************************

Our input data consists of lines containing customer names. Each name is prefixed with a 4 character reference id.

Write a slicing expression that will get the name from each line but without the prefix.

Example Input records:

1001: Fred
1002: Fredrick
1107: Art
2134: Ebeneezer

Example output:

Fred
Fredrick
Art
Ebeneezer


Question 3 **************************************************************

Write a program that prompts the user to input a word.

If the word is a pallindrome print "It's a PALLINDROME" otherwise print "It's not a PALLINDROME".

NOTE: A pallindrome is a word that is spelled the same backwards as forwards:

	e.g. racecar, kayak

HINT: the third parameter to a string slice is the step size. A step size of -1 will iterate over the word in reverse.


Question 4 **************************************************************


Write a program to check for valid reference ids entered by the user.

A reference id is considered valid if it contains only alphanumeric characters and starts with 2 uppercase letters and ends with 2 digits.

If the string entered is valid print "VALID" otherwise print "INVALID"

Example 1:

	AB12wrt12

		VALID


	Aqwert12

		INVALID


	RTas_jk34

		INVALID

					

Question 5 **************************************************************


Write a program that prompts the user for a string.

If the string contains an even number of characters, output the string with the second half of the string in upper case.

If the input string has an odd number of characters output the message:- "The string must have an even number of characters" instead.



Question 6 **************************************************************


Web pages are made up of markup code words which are surrounded by angle brackets '<>'

Unfortunately we have found corrupted pages that have the angle bracekts added incorrectly.

For example  <HTML> has been output as >HTML< and <BODY> is output as >BODY<

Write a program to correct these tags by swapping the first and last character of the markup words.


Question 7 **************************************************************

There's an old saying that it's not a good idea to 'put the cart before the horse'

Write a program to check if the string 'cart' occurs before the string 'horse' in the example strings below.

Print "BAD IDEA" if 'cart' occurs before 'horse', otherwise print "OK".

If either string is not in the input string print "Ooops, missing data"

Example 1:  

	"my favourite cartoon is all about a horse"

	BAD IDEA

Example 2:

	"my kingdom for a horse, or even a cart"

	OK

Example 3:

	"a horse with no name"

	"Ooops, missing data"


Question 8 **************************************************************


You've heard of looking for a tiny needle in a huge haystack.

Print the output of a slicing expression to find the word 'needle' in the following string:

haystack = "not every tweet adds jolly greetings"

HINT: the third parameter of the slicing syntax is the step size
