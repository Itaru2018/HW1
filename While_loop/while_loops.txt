Question 1 ) ************************************************************************************************

	Prompt the user to enter a number.

	Using a while loop and the % (modulo operator) print out all the even numbers up to the number the user entered.
	
	
Question 2 ) ************************************************************************************************

	Prompt the user to enter a series of numbers, one at a time
	
	If the user enters 0 stop the program and print out the largest number they entered

Question 3 ) ************************************************************************************************

	Create a guessing game :-

	Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 10

	If the guess is not correct prompt the user to try again

	If the the guess is correct print a message and finish

	Keep a count of the number of guesses and display it when the guess is correct

	Example:

		Guess the Number: 7
		Guess the Number: 5
		Guess the Number: 9
		Guess the Number: 2
		Yippeee! The number is 2, You used 4 guesses

	Note: Start your program with the following lines to generate a random number between 1 and 10

	import random

	number = random.randint(1, 10)

Question 4 ) ************************************************************************************************


	Modify Question 3) to increase the range of numbers from 1 to 64

	When the user makes an incorrect guess give them a hint by printing whether their guess was too small or too big

	Example:-

		Guess the Number: 44
		Ooops! Too Big
		Guess the Number: 42
		Ooops! Too Big
		Guess the Number: 38
		Ooops! Too Small
		Guess the Number: 39
		Ooops! Too Small
		Guess the Number: 40
		Yippeee! The number is 40, You used 5 guesses


Question 5 ) ************************************************************************************************

Prompt the user to enter a series of numbers, one at a time.

Keep prompting for numbers until the sum of the numbers entered is more than 1000, then print the sum.
